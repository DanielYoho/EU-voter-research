### An analysis of voter satisfaction and its effect on turnout in the 2024 European Parliament elections using 2024 Eurobarometer survey data

This research project was completed as coursework for my PS1702 - Visualizing and Understanding Social Data course. I used a .csv file from the Eurobarometer public survey data, cleaning it and narrowing it down to a handful of variables that were pertinent to my research. I used R Markdown along with the ggplot2 package to visualize and analyze the data, asking the question: **Does an EU resident's satisfaction with how democracy works under the EU have any effect on their likelihood of voting?** 

Among my analysis methods, I selected control variables and created a multivariate regression model to determine the statistical significance of my explanatory variable (voter satisfaction), using a coefficient plot to visualize predictors of voter turnout. I also examined the main relationship via a line plot, introducing third variables to explore any possible confounders. 

## Methods

Data sourced from Eurobarometer 2024 survey **FIND SPECIFIC SURVEY**

Cleaned and visualized using R Markdown with ggplot2, dplyr, and broom packages

Focused on 2024 survey data from all EU member states 

## Key Questions

Does voter satisfaction have an affect on likelihood of voting?

Are there any confounders? 

Are there any statistically significant predictors that have a stronger effect on turnout?

Do any relationships appear when aggregating the data for country-level analysis?
